Mitu is the largest Latinx social media organization in the nation. When in 2015 they launched the hashtag, #ImNotACriminal, the company was intentional in utilizing social media influencers and content creators as catalysts, tapping into an audience of frequent internet users to spread their message. Within only a few hours, the organization reported over 28 million impressions, demonstrating how their presence on the internet was both a tool for community organizing—a way of creating spaciousness for Latinx discourse—and a means of civic engagement. Latinx voters are reported having the highest engagement on Facebook compared to other racial ethnic groups, and the video posted to their Facebook account of millennial-aged voters reacting to Trump’s xenophobic comments of Latinx immigrants showcases their taking back of the microphone and producing a tangible voter outcome from this presence. 

In the years of Trump’s Administration, bilingualism and the public presence of the Spanish language was considered to be under erasure. However, the xenophobic sentiment that gave rise to Trump’s presidency had been festering for decades prior. In 1998, the state of California legalized Proposition 227 which had the goal of limiting bilingual education. There had been a growing yet unfounded fear that second-generation Latinx immigrants and language minority students were failing to grasp the language in the classroom, and the proposition remained active until 2016 when it was overturned with the California Non-English Languages Allowed in Public Education Act. In a study conducted by researchers at California State University and Arizona State University that set out to analyze the use of the Spanish language as an act of political resistance, surveyed students reported an increased motivation to use Spanish “cuando Trump se hizo presidente” (Fernando, CA, Sánchez-Muñoz and Amezcua). 

No tenían miedo. And similar to the #SomosMitu users, the Spanish speakers who noted a clear change in attitude and resistance in using the language also expressed a change toward activism and increased political consciousness. “Antes que fuera elegido Trump como presidente, no me fijaba tanto en lo que estaba pasando en el mundo, como las cosas de la inmigración o las cosas políticas. No fue hasta que empezaron las elecciones, que una maestra nos puso a ver los debates políticos como tarea, que puse más atención a las cosas que quiere hacer Trump,” reported one student (Sardin, AZ, Sánchez-Munoz and Amezcua). Young voters especially were creating rhetorical spaces for Latinx political engagement, and much of this community organizing around the hashtags occurred on Twitter. 

On February 16, 2017, a national #DayWithoutImmigrants saw dozens of businesses and stores across the city of California closed in solidarity with whom the White House were labeling illegal immigrants. “Apoyamos al Inmigrante,'' one sign outside of La Parilla Mexican kitchen read. The hashtag also gained attraction under #UnDiaSinInmigrantes, showing once again the use of bilingualism for public coalition and political action. An account under the name “@tracktheban” reported on the event, posting a video on the University of Southern California Annenberg Media site of the city looking “desserted,” specifically along Santee Alley, a block where businesses are usually open seven days a week. Having spoken with shop owners, the reporters noted that the majority of the businesses were run by immigrants, making it no surprise that they were closed in solidarity with their fellow citizens. Some posts under the hashtag highlighted entire classrooms empty without the presence of immigrants, making a jarring statement of what life in Los Angeles would look like without the presence of immigrants as peers, classmates, and colleagues to those calling for their political disenfranchisement. 

The United States makes up one of the largest Spanish-speaking countries in the world, with the city of Los Angeles containing one of the largest majorities of Latinx immigrants nationwide. The emergence of social media, especially Twitter, as a powerful tool for community organizing within Latinx populations is vividly illustrated through these initiatives. The #SomosMitu and #ImNotACriminal campaign, #DayWithoutImmigrants strike, and related movements highlight the role of digital platforms in fostering a sense of citizenship and belonging among Latinx communities. In an era marked by divisive political rhetoric, these online movements have provided a vital space for Latinx voices, harnessing the power of bilingualism and digital engagement to create inclusive narratives and promote active civic participation. This trend underscores the evolving nature of political activism, where social media serves not just as a medium for communication, but as a dynamic arena for cultural affirmation and political mobilization.

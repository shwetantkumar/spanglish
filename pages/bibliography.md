The Trump presidency marked the beginning of an especially divisive moment in the political sphere. With specific racist and ethnically exclusive rhetorics moving further into the mainstream, and an ever-increasing public presence on social media, we bore witness to collective correspondence like never before.

Our project hopes to illustrate the defense of LatinX communities and coalitions as illustrated through cultural objects, in this case Tweets, that we believe easily and accessibly reflect the work of activists. We have identified the Trump Presidency as the most identifiable surge of discourses on social media that reflect these processes in the context of emergent neo-nationalist sentiment. Specifically, we hope to collect data originating from Los Angeles County in California to best represent racial, ethnic, and political diversity over a relatively confined area.

Through digital tools, we hoped to illustrate different ways that activists have identified with their ethnic and racial backgrounds. We specifically aimed to highlight the way that conversations around citizenship and immigration are enriched by incorporation of the unique experience of Latin American diasporic communities in Los Angeles. To illustrate this appealingly, and with an emphasis on examples found in the modern era, we turned to social media. Twitter (or X as it is now referred) provided a publically accessible medium for the disclosure of politically and otherwise societally motivated sentiments, while also providing specific search capabilities once we had identified terms of interest.

We envisioned a static archive to enable viewers to explore hashtags and social movements they may not be familiar with, paired with screenshots of related Tweets to aid in the illustration of specific socially determined linguistic phenomena. 

This team determined analysis of these goings-on, in the perspective of this medium, to be our desired method of demonstrating how ethnic groups go about expressing the sentiments they identify with and how members of these groups define themselves in the context of these movements. As we assembled lists of hashtags we decided were of greatest consequence, as we employed geolocators and came to the conclusion that Los Angeles County, California, best represents the ethnic melting pot we had hoped to capture, we began to acknowledge the impossibility of capturing every point of data, every perspective. We understand that in any such agglomeration of identity affiliations, there will be some ideal, some story, some person who is unaccounted for. We hope to have represented as many opinions and likenesses as possible.

**Afterword**<br>
Our data mainly consists of tweets we identified as commentary on political goings-on beginning with the Trump Presidency. Using specific geolocator tags we were able to source a majority of statements from the county of Los Angeles in California. We identified this area as a major site of political unrest with a specific emphasis on racial inequalities. In a region so concentrated with ethnic minorities, with such a rich history of immigration and a large racially diverse population, we believed the social media correspondences would best reflect a wide array of sentiments.

First identifying hashtags that meant a great deal to these movements, we were able to assemble more general understandings of the events transpiring at the time. We initially struggled to limit the scope of such ideological expressions to the Trump era, until we identified specific tweet search parameters that allowed us to filter tweets under the hashtags based on date published.

We also found difficulty quantifying the popularity of hashtags, as most software enabling front-end usage tracking had some sort of cost associated. Ultimately, we were introduced by Professor Gil to the Google Chrome plug-in that we would ultimately employ to render a more conclusive analysis of tweets connected to the hashtags we designated as significant.

Our attempt at producing visualizations to hopefully invoke analysis of community ideals at such a politically divisive point in our country’s history would not be possible without the guidance of Professor Alexander Gil Fuentes, to whom we owe a special debt of gratitude. He has proven peerless in his ability to identify solutions, outline potential issues, and cautiously direct our efforts so as to not spoil our individual explorations into the field. His extensive experiences and thoughtful creations inspired this team to investigate what we determined to be of our greatest interest, no matter our perceived limitations.

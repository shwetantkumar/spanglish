The Latinx community played a pivotal role in shaping the narrative surrounding immigration during Donald Trump's presidency. Its impact within the Los Angeles (LA) region, which houses a significant portion of California's Latinx population, unveils a complex tapestry influenced by factors such as DACA repeal, the use of social media activism, Trump's border wall agenda, and the electoral dynamics of the 2016 election. This exhibit has been conceived as a pathway through the tweets and hashtags created by the Los Angeles and California Latinx community under these circumstances, and the way in which they shaped the social resistance to the immigration policies of Trump’s administration.

As Jaime Dominguez established after the 2016 election, it was precisely during this year’s campaign that the U.S. population realized to what extent the Latinx or Hispanic community was heterogeneous and diverse. There are stratifications between them, as for instance political appeal for Cuban Americans in Florida might be different than for Chicano communities in Chicago. In the case of California, it is important to bear in mind that although the number of undocumented immigration was falling through Trump’s government, it was still the highest in the country. The Latinx community in Los Angeles was particularly sensitive to Trump’s proposals and policies related to immigration.

The 2016 U.S. presidential election remains a subject of intense analysis and discussion, particularly regarding the dynamics that allowed Donald Trump to secure victory in the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote. The electorate's composition, as outlined in a detailed report by Pew Research, revealed a diverse and multifaceted group of validated voters. Factors such as demographics, regional variations, and voter turnout played crucial roles in shaping the outcome. The reasons behind the electoral triumph include factors like the appeal of his outsider status, a strategic focus on key swing states, and a populist message that resonated with a significant portion of the electorate. The 2016 election, with its unique blend of circumstances, has had a lasting impact on political discourse, prompting ongoing discussions about the electoral system, the role of demographics, and the potential implications for future presidential contests. Among Latinx communities in the Los Angeles area, the distance between electoral vote and popular vote augmented the tension.

In February 2017, writer and activist Sean McElwee first tweeted #AbolishICE to create a social media movement in order to end the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. McElwee argued that Twitter was the ideal platform to spread these ideas, noting that it had the power to be not just a viral moment, but a catalyst for a greater national discussion towards a future without ICE enforcement. The hashtag triumphed, and some congress people adopted the phrase, creating the possibility of a debate on border enforcement. The Latinx community in the Los Angeles area continued these strategies, in their concern with Trump’s immigration policies.

Donald Trump's controversial move to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program sparked intense debate and drew attention to the plight of DREAMers. In September 2017, Trump signaled the end of DACA and urged Congress to take legislative action. The decision was met with criticism, as it put the status of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the United States as children into uncertainty. Subsequent NPR coverage in June 2017 highlighted Trump's decision to allow DREAMers to stay in the country while simultaneously removing protections for their parents. Notably, social media, particularly Twitter, became a powerful platform for advocacy as seen in the use of #DefendDACA (as well as #DACA and #heretostay).

During his presidency, Donald Trump fervently advocated for the construction of a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, framing it as a crucial component of a "world-class security system." In a PBS interview, Trump emphasized the wall's significance in bolstering national security and deterring illegal immigration. However, the New York Times's fact-checking analysis scrutinized the claims surrounding the border wall to reveal discrepancies in Trump's assertions. The report questioned the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed barrier, highlighting challenges such as terrain variations and the prevalence of existing barriers. The debate over the border wall became emblematic of broader discussions on immigration policy, governmental spending, and the efficacy of physical barriers in addressing complex geopolitical issues. The Trump administration's push for the wall underscored the deep divisions surrounding immigration policy and sparked ongoing debates about the appropriate means of securing national borders under the hashtag, #noborderwall.

As the Latinx community in Los Angeles engaged in these discussions and resisted policies through activism across physical and online platforms, it not only navigated the challenges imposed by Trump's administration but also contributed to a broader dialogue on immigration that transcended regional boundaries and resonated nationwide. #AbolishICE, #DefendDACA, and #noborderwall were instrumental to the creation of resistance and expressions of discomfort regarding immigration during Trump’s administration.
